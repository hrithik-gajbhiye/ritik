  birthdayDay:   19,          // Day of the birthday (e.g., 19)
  timeZone:      "Asia/Kolkata", // Your timezone
  passcode:      "birthday",  // Change or keep your secret unlock password!
  friendName:    "Bestie",    // Friend's name or nickname

  // 8 Polaroid Memories on the Blooming Tree
  gallery: [
    { caption: "Our First Selfie", stamp: "#Memories", tilt: -2.5, img: "assets/images/memory-1.webp", icon: "📸" },
    { caption: "Milestone Moments", stamp: "#Victories", tilt: 3.2, img: "assets/images/memory-2.webp", icon: "⭐" },
    // ... customize captions for all 8 memories
  ],
